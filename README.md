## 🧠 Reflections & Notes

### Day 1 – 13 Aug
> Started with foundational network security concepts. Revisiting TCP/IP and packet inspection helped clarify Wireshark usage. Felt a bit slow but solid.

### Day 2 – 14 August
> Worked on the OpenCTI platform, investigated the techniques, tools, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT29 (Cozy Bear :bear: - Russia says Hi :wave:) and mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Very cool platform with multiple helpful features (Overview, Knowledge, History, Attribution, IOCs and many more...)
